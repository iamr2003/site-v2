# Astro Is Neat

I am migrating my personal site to [Astro](https://astro.build/) , here some things I find neat about it.


## Compatibility with existing Frameworks

Astro is a meta framework, it is compatible with many different UI frameworks at once, even all together.
The following is not practical, but fun:

This article itself was written mostly in markdown, with some light styling and JS integration for the above.

## Painless Routing
Routing is just folders, I can easily spin up anything where I want and it just works.
I want this site to be able to host documentation and demo for the projects I do, so this is very convenient, combined with all the compatibility.

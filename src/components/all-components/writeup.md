# Astro Is Neat

I am migrating my personal site to [Astro](https://astro.build/) , here some things I find neat about it.

## Painless Routing
Routing is just folders, I can easily spin up anything where I want and it just works.
I want this site to be able to host documentation and demo for the projects I do, so this is very convenient, combined with the following compatibility. 

## Compatibility with existing Frameworks

Astro is a meta framework, it is compatible with many different UI frameworks at once, even all together.
The Demo at the bottom here is not practical, but it is fun.
Every single one of those components is running in their respective frameworks!

This article itself was written mostly in markdown, you can look at how all pieces got integrated together [here](https://github.com/iamr2003/site-v2/blob/master/src/pages/all-components.astro).
